[CV](/assets/CV_en_Cedric_Foucault_2023.pdf)

I’m a third-year PhD student in cognitive computational neuroscience at NeuroSpin, University of Paris-Saclay, supervised by Florent Meyniel in the [Computational Brain team](https://www.unicog.org/lab/the-computational-brain/). In 2024, I will be working in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford as a Junior Research Fellow at Christ Church College.

My research broadly seeks to understand learning and decision-making processes  in humans faced with dynamic environments, using computational modeling, behavioral and neuroimaging experiments. During my PhD, I’ve specifically studied adaptive learning under uncertainty, through three studies:

1. A behavioral study looking at the trial-by-trial dynamics of human adaptive learning and investigating their computational determinants. Preprint available on bioRxiv: [doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.18.553813](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.18.553813) (Foucault & Meyniel, 2023).

2. A theoretical study focusing on mechanisms. I studied the mechanisms that allow recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to achieve adaptive learning abilities in dynamic probabilistic tasks. Research article published in eLife: [doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71801](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71801) (Foucault & Meyniel, 2021). Code available [on GitHub](https://github.com/cedricfoucault/networks_for_sequence_prediction).

3. An fMRI study entitled "A neural codes for probabilities", investigating how probabilities are neurally encoded in human brain activity. Paper in preparation.

Previously, I did a Master of research in cognitive neuroscience at the École Normale Supérieure de Paris (2018 - 2020), a Master of research in computer science at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (2010 – 2014), and worked as an iOS Software engineer at Apple in California in between (2015 – 2018).
