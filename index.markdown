[CV](/assets/CV_en_Cedric_Foucault_2023.pdf)

I’m a third-year PhD student in cognitive computational neuroscience at NeuroSpin, supervised by Florent Meyniel in the [Computational Brain team](https://www.unicog.org/lab/the-computational-brain/). In 2024, I will be a Junior Research Fellow at Christ Church, University of Oxford.

My research broadly seeks to understand the learning and decision-making processes involved when humans are confronted with dynamic and changing environments, using computational models, behavioural and neuroimaging experiments. During my PhD, I've specifically studied learning and the dynamic and adaptive nature of learning, through multiple levels of investigation:

1. At the computational level. I studied how recurrent neural networks (RNNs) solve dynamic learning tasks and dissected their mechanisms to understand how it could be done in the brain. Research article published: [Foucault & Meyniel, 2021, eLife, doi: 10.7554/eLife.71801](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71801). [Code available on GitHub](https://github.com/cedricfoucault/networks_for_sequence_prediction).

2. At the neural level. fMRI project entitled "A neural code for probabilities". I am investigating how probabilities are neurally encoded as they are learned by the human brain. Paper in preparation.

3. At the behavioural level. I've conducted a study using a novel paradigm specifically designed to measure the fine-grained dynamics of learning in humans, via continuous behavior tracking. Paper in preparation.

Previously, I did a Master of research in cognitive neuroscience at the École Normale Supérieure de Paris (2018 - 2020), a Master of research in computer science at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (2010 – 2014), and worked as an iOS Software engineer at Apple in California in between (2015 – 2018).
