[CV](/assets/CV_Cedric_Foucault_2024-03.pdf)

I am interested in developing mathematical and computational models of cognition, with the aim of understanding the processes by which people solve the problems they face in everyday life, and how these processes are carried out in the brain. I study problems such as inference, learning and decision-making, and how they are solved over time in dynamic environments.

Since March 2024, I am a Junior Research Fellow of the Christ Church College at the University of Oxford. I am conducting my research in the Department of Experimental Psychology in collaboration with Laurence Hunt's lab and Matthew Rushworth's lab.

I completed my PhD in cognitive computational neuroscience between September 2020 and December 2023 under the supervision of Florent Meyniel at NeuroSpin (INSERM-CEA), in affiliation with University of Paris-Saclay and Sorbonne University. During my PhD, I studied the computational and neural bases of learning and probabilistic inference in the human brain using behaviour, fMRI, Bayesian models and recurrent neural networks.

Prior to this, I did a Master of research in cognitive neuroscience at the École Normale Supérieure de Paris (2018 - 2020), a Master of research in computer science at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (2010 – 2014), and worked as an iOS Software engineer at Apple in California in between (2015 – 2018).
