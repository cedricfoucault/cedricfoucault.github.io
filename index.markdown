[CV](/assets/CV_us_cedric_2021-12.pdf)

I’m a second-year PhD student at NeuroSpin under the supervision of Florent Meyniel in the [Computational Brain team](https://www.unicog.org/lab/the-computational-brain/). I am interested in using mathematical and computational models to understand human behavior and the cognitive processes that underlie it, in relation to the brain and its environment. I wish to pursue a career in research in cognitive and computational neuroscience.

Previously, I completed a double Bachelor in computer science and in applied physics and a Master of research in computer science at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (2010 – 2014) after being admitted on competitive examination following the French classes préparatoires (2008 – 2010). Then, I worked as an iOS Software engineer at Apple in California (2015 – 2018). Finally, I completed a Master of research in cognitive science at the École Normale Supérieure of Paris (2018 – 2020) to prepare my current thesis (2020 – 2023). I will be looking for a postdoctoral position starting at the end of 2023 or beginning of 2024.

During my PhD with Florent Meyniel, I have studied different architectures of recurrent neural networks and dissected their mechanisms to understand how the brain can optimally predict what is going to happen despite being confronted with uncertainty, changes, and various forms of hidden regularities in the environment. We have published a [research article at eLife](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71801) on this work and made the [code available on GitHub](https://github.com/cedricfoucault/networks_for_sequence_prediction). Next, we plan to explore the neural representations observed in the human brain with fMRI in this type of tasks, and to design a new experimental task to collect finer-grained behavioral data and better tease out our models.

In the past, I also published several research works in human-computer interaction before I turned to cognitive neuroscience.

You can find out more about my education, research experience, publications, presentations, and teaching on my above CV.

I'm always glad to talk with other researchers about cognition, behavior and the brain. I'm also open to future opportunities to leverage my skills to advance science in these areas, and continue to grow as both a modeler and an experimentalist. Feel free to contact me at my email above.
